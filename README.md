# Cat Game

## Description

This text-based command line game begins by the player starting as a cat waking up from a long nap. Due to such a long sleep, you are now hungry but are unable to feed yourself. You need the human to feed you but you are unsure of where they are in the house. Therefore, you must search thoughout the house for the human. But you better hurry, as time may run out before you need to nap once more.

This was developed as a final project for CS162.
